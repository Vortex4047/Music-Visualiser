## Testing Instructions

1. Test each audio file with both file upload and microphone input
2. Verify that the genre detection works correctly for each file
3. Verify that the beat detection and visualization respond appropriately to the audio
4. Verify that the UI updates correctly with genre and beat information
5. Verify that the visualization container animations match the detected genre
6. Test with different file formats (MP3, WAV, OGG)
7. Test with different file sizes and durations
8. Test with both short clips (10-30 seconds) and longer tracks (1-5 minutes)

## Expected Results

- Beat detection should respond to the tempo of the music
- Visualization should be visually appealing and responsive to the audio
- UI should update in real-time with genre and beat information
- Application should handle errors gracefully (e.g., unsupported file formats)
